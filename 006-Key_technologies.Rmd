# Key Technologies

git and gitlab for versioning in collaborative plaintext document editing markdown as a simple to use plaintext markup lanugage Rmarkdown/kintr/pandoc with Rstudio as document editor/renderer literate programming gitlab ci-cd / docker for reproducible computational environments and automated checking automatically see if your edit to a manuscript if that change breaks a formatting rule automated QC checking and helping, readability analysis, plagarism, stats checks etc.

## Literate Programming

*The case for writing in plain text *

[Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)

Why would I write in a plain text file when I could use something like word or google docs?

Here is ~98% of all the markdown syntax you are likely to need to know:

    # Heading 1

    ## Heading 2

    ## Heading 3 {h3}

	a reference to a section \@ref(h3)

    - bullet point
    - another point

	1. *italics!*
	2. __Bold__

    [hyperlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)
    
    Images: [!Alt text](path/to/image)

    an inline reference to @key123 or a parenthasized one [@key123]
    
    inline `code`

    ```
    # A block of code
    print("Hello, World!")

    ```
    
    If using mathjax or a simialar tool: inline latex math: $\frac{x}{y}$
    
    Equations:
    
    $$
    a=\frac{x}{y^2}
    $$
    

If you can learn to use some of the slightly more advanced features of MS 
Word like styles, sections, track changes or automated reference management you can learn markdown pretty easily.
Also there are now some quite nice visual editors to give you more of the WYSIWYG editing experience if you need a leg-up with the syntax, there is one built right into the tool I'm authoring this document in right now [RStudio](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/). 
It even has a nice feature that will let me insert references from my [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) library or by DOI search and add them to the bibliography for this [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) project.
Also as I write this it is being rendered every time this file is saved to a window I have open on my second monitor so I can see what you will be seeing.

NB Markdown's competitors that largely lost the format wars [reStructuredText (rST)](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/restructuredtext-vs-markdown-for-technical-documentation/) and [AsciiDoc](https://medium.com/@Mister_Gold/stop-using-markdown-for-documentation-5bda05ad17e3) would arguably be a better choice for the text-based *lingua franka* format of academic publication going forward but the tooling and ecosystem around these is just not quite as mature.

## Collaboration and version control with `git`

git is a tool used by programmers to keep track of and navigate through the history of changes they have made to code, also to collaborate on code 

## Containers and build pipelines



## Why not Blockchain (yet)?

All this stuff about putting up a bounty, being able to claim that bounty, having amounts of money accrue back to certain parties, doing compute, covering the cost of compute, being open and public sounds like the sort of thing that would gel really interestingly with blockchain with smart contracts and distributed compute?
- I hear you ask.
Yes, I answer, but the tooling is not there and the ecosystem is not yet mature enough a version of what I am proposing here built on blockchain technology is something that I expect to see in the future.
It would be a barrier to the wider adoption of my proposed approach until such time as crypto has gained wider acceptance.
There are many potential advantages: Cyptographically backed identity management for authors, very robust provenance of ideas in a public record, preventing the raising of barriers to knowledge or censorship by governmental of corporate entities through its decentralized nature, etc.
There is potential regulatory complexity around the bounty based model proposed here as any situation where you are holding money which you may at some point be obliged to give back to another party tends to attract a lot of red tape.
The relative regulatory Crypto Cardano is think the most likely candidate in the current crypto market to be the basis for such a system given it's technical characteristics and its governance structure's fondness for peer-review.
(Declaration of interest: I have some modest investments in cardano, etherium, bitcoin and monero)
